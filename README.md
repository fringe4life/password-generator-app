## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- ✅ Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- ✅ Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- ✅ See a strength rating for their generated password
- ✅ View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- ✅ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (HSL color format)
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first responsive workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Modern CSS animations with `prefers-reduced-motion` support

### What I learned

This project reinforced several important concepts:

**CSS Architecture & Best Practices:**
- Using HSL color format for better maintainability and readability
- Converting pixel values to rem units for better accessibility
- Implementing CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Creating responsive designs with mobile-first approach

**JavaScript Modern Patterns:**
- ES6+ class-based architecture for better code organization
- Async/await for clipboard operations with fallback support
- Event delegation and proper event handling
- Password strength calculation algorithms

**Accessibility & UX:**
- Implementing proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support (Ctrl+Enter to generate, Ctrl+C to copy)
- Respecting user's motion preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Providing visual feedback for all user interactions

**Password Security:**
- Ensuring at least one character from each selected character type
- Implementing proper password shuffling algorithms
- Creating meaningful strength indicators based on multiple factors

Here's a code snippet I'm particularly proud of - the password strength calculation:

```javascript
calculatePasswordStrength(password) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Length contribution
  if (password.length >= 8) score += 1;
  if (password.length >= 12) score += 1;
  if (password.length >= 16) score += 1;
  
  // Character variety contribution
  const hasUppercase = /[A-Z]/.test(password);
  const hasLowercase = /[a-z]/.test(password);
  const hasNumbers = /\d/.test(password);
  const hasSymbols = /[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{}|;:,.<>?]/.test(password);
  
  const varietyCount = [hasUppercase, hasLowercase, hasNumbers, hasSymbols]
    .filter(Boolean).length;
  
  score += varietyCount - 1;
  
  // Bonus for mixed case and symbols
  if (hasUppercase && hasLowercase) score += 1;
  if (hasNumbers && hasSymbols) score += 1;
  
  return Math.min(score, 4);
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I'd like to continue focusing on in future projects:

1. **Advanced CSS Techniques**: Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts and CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
2. **JavaScript Performance**: Implementing more efficient algorithms and exploring Web Workers for heavy computations
3. **Accessibility**: Deepening my understanding of WCAG guidelines and implementing more advanced accessibility features
4. **Testing**: Adding unit tests and integration tests for JavaScript functionality
5. **Build Tools**: Exploring modern build tools and optimization techniques
